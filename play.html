    <h3>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h3>
    <h4>Act 3: Scene 1 - The wood. Titania lying asleep.</h4>

    <p class="stage-direction">Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</p>

    <h5 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h5>
    <p class="speech">Are we all met?</p>

    <h5 class="name quince">QUINCE</h5>
    <p class="speech">Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
    for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
    stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
    will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</p>

    <h5 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h5>
    <p class="speech">Peter Quince,--</p>

    <h5 class="name quince">QUINCE</h5>
    <p class="speech">What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</p>

    <h5 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h5>
    <p class="speech">There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
    Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
    draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
    cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>

    <h5 class="name snout">SNOUT</h5>
    <p class="speech">By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>

    <h5 class="name starveling">STARVELING</h5>
    <p class="speech">I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</p>

    <h5 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h5>
    <p class="speech">Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
    Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
    say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
    Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
    better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
    Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
    out of fear.</p>

    <h5 class="name quince">QUINCE</h5>
    <p class="speech">Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
    written in eight and six.</p>
